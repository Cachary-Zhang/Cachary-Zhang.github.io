<font color=Blue>Hi, YOU REALLY FIND A GREAT BOY!</font> Welcome to my Homepage! My name is **Zihan Zhang**. I am a first year Ph.D student in Institute of Vehicle Propulsion, Zhejiang University (2025-future), supervised by [Prof.Jiaqi Luo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0018086#956496). I major in machanical engineering, mainly doing research in Computational Fluid Mechanics (Aerodynamic Uncertainty Quantification). I have received my Bachelor's degree from Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin (2021-2025), major in Aircraft Dynamics Engineering, under the supervision of <font color=Gray>Xiaomin-Zhang</font>.

- *2025.08 - now*: I am currently focused on developing a methodology for addressing engineered **Turboblade design**, which can not only design turboblade positively by using several design parameters, but also can solve backward acccording to the known points.

# üî• News
- *2024.01*: &nbsp;üéâüéâ My [first paper](https://github.com/Cachary-Zhang/Cachary-Zhang.github.io/edit/main/docs/Design and Error Analysis of Open-Loop Trajectory Carbon-Free Trolley.pdf) is accepted by Machinery Design & Manufacture.
- *2023.11*: &nbsp;üéâüéâ I complete my first paper and submit it to [Machinery Design & Manufacture](https://jsyz.cbpt.cnki.net/WKE/WebPublication/index.aspx?mid=JSYZ).
